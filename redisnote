====================================================================
Redis - open source s/w
====================================================================


Why we use the redis

In our table have some data are static its not changable then we dont have to get the data from database every time we have to get the data
from the mysql network call is here 

In Memory Database In redis data save in the ram not in harddisk

In my sql data store in hard disk

It is like empaty memory

no sql , no tables, no squense, no joins etc

 we can store data type in resdis string, hashoperation , list, set etc
 
 Cache Manager
 
 message broker 
 

after downloading the redis hit the command redis-server
            
                       crate the connection
          requet       jedis and lettuce
 client ------ server --------- redis   ----- ----database

we can store the data in redis in the form of  string . List, set . Hash

exceptionally fast redis is very fast and can perform about 110000 set s per scond about 81000 gets per second


how to check the redis is running in my system by using this command

ps aux | grep redis-server

how to set the value in string value by command propmt

SET email "domain@gmail.com" EX 60 this value of key only store for 60 second 

get the value from the key 

get email  command for get the value


if you get the multipale key mget 


if you want to set the expire time ------  expire key 60

check how to expire time expire key 

to check the all key *

delete the all key flushall 
==========================================================
To Set the data in list 
=========================================================
lpush key value value value

like this

 LPUSH values rushi harshil
 
 lrange values 0 -1 to get the all data list data
 
 to check the length of the key
 
 lle key 
 
 to remove the frist value 
 lpop values
 
 here values is key
 
 to remove the last value
 rpop values
 
 here values is key 
 
 if we want to change the value from the list 
           
           
           key            
 linsert products before car  bike // 
 
 linsert products after car  bike //
 
 
 
 here over requirment is to we have to check the value is available if not available then set
